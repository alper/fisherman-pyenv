# Pyenv

[pyenv] plugin support for the fish shell.

## Install

With [fisherman]

```
fisher install bonds/fisherman-pyenv
```

## Notes

This plugin replaces what `status --is-interactive; and . (pyenv init -|psub)`
does in a more fishy way. This brings the startup time of your shell down
as we do not generate full completions every time the shell starts but only
when `pyenv` gets called.
